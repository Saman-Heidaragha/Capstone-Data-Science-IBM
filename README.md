# Capstone Data Science Project - Coursera

Welcome to my Data Science Capstone project! This project is part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, where I put everything I've learned into practice by analyzing a dataset, building a model, and drawing meaningful insights from it.

## About the Project

For this project, I worked with a dataset to explore, clean, and analyze the data. I applied a variety of data science techniques to uncover trends and patterns, and then built a model to predict future outcomes. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to handle real-world data and make data-driven decisions.

## The Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from SpaceX. I spent some time cleaning and preparing the data to make sure it was ready for analysis.

## Project Files

Here's a quick rundown of the files in this repo:

- data: Raw and processed data files.  
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks where I did most of the analysis and modeling.  
- scripts: Python or R scripts used for data cleaning and processing.  
- outputs: All the visualizations, reports, and model files I generated.  
- README.md: This file, giving you the rundown of the project.
